# House Rules

## Character Building

### Sources
Character options (including races, classes, spells, feats, etc.) from the *Player's Handbook*, *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, and *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* are all fair game.

### Races
In addition to the races available in the *Player's Handbook*, the following playable races are available in our version of Wildemount:

**Aarakocra**, bird-like humanoids who roost on isolated mountaintops

**Aasimar**, beings who gain supernatural power from the angelic spark in their souls

**Eladrin**, elves of the Feywild with seasonal affinities that affect their mood and appearance

**Fairies**, wee folk from the Feywild who usually look like Small elves with insectile wings

**Firbolgs**, forest guardians who engage in peaceful methods to protect their homes

**Genasi**, humanoids imbued with elemental power as a result of their birth

**Goblins**, outcast scavengers descended from the experiments of a dark god

**Goliaths**, hulking wanderers who dwell atop the highest mountains

**Harengons**, rabbitfolk blessed with a little fey luck

**Tabaxi**, catlike humanoids who are often agile, witty, and playful

**Tortles**, tortoise-like humanoids with an innate connection to the sea

### Feats
> A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.
>
> At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.
>
> You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow — perhaps by a withering curse — you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

Player characters may take a single feat of their choice at level 1 (this means Variant Humans start with 2 feats), and may choose to take additional feats in place of ability score improvements as they level up.

### Multiclassing
Player characters may take levels in multiple classes, following the optional multiclassing rules presented in the *Player's Handbook*.

> Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.
>
> With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.
>
> As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

This option offers more versatility for creating unique characters, but greatly increases the complexity of character building, and thus is not necessarily recommended for new players.

## Combat

### Potions
Drinking a potion takes a bonus action.

### Flanking
When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.

A creature can’t flank an enemy that it can’t see. A creature also can’t flank while it is incapacitated.

Flanking is not affected by the direction a creature is facing.

### Glancing Blows
Attacks that exactly match the target's armor class do half damage.
